					A pair who is after full of fun and excitement.<br><br>
					Sagittarians - philosophical and always look for knowledge. They love to be with their intellectual companion.
					<br><br>
					As both are having same habits and attitudes , this relationship will be happy and easy going.

		<li>
			<div class="slidepage">
				<div class="slidetext">
				Both are independent and loves their freedom.<br>
				Both are highly social and love to interact with new people.
				<br><br>
				One good quality of this pair is that they never develop jealous between them.
				</div>
			</div>
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="slidepage">
				<div class="slidetext">
				One negative aspect of this combination is that when two Sagittarians combine there is a chance to develop silliness,
				so either one need to look life with a bit of seriousness to achieve their goals.
				<br><br>
				Also , anger flies quickly with Sagittarians, but that may not be long lasting as they quickly forget things and moves on.
				<br><br>
				Overall this is one of the long lasting pairs with greater affinity.
